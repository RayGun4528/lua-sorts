Implementation of 25 sorting algorithms in Lua that was made for my [sorting algorithm visualiser](https://www.roblox.com/games/9198863110) on Roblox, open-sourced.
The code of the sorting algorithms was adapted or ported to Lua from various sources (mostly from [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)).

The sorting algorithms should work more or less with integers (positive and negative, I've modified some of them to allow sorting negative integers). However, some of the sorting algorithms doesn't work with floats.

To test out the sorting algorithms to ensure they are working correctly, run the (`test.lua`) file.
